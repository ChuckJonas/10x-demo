Plan:

The app that we will be creating is a Typescript/Node CLI application named "sugarcrm_export". The aim of this application is to export modules data such as Accounts, Opportunities, Contacts, etc from the SugarCRM and write it to a CSV file.

The app will consist of the following files:

1. `index.ts`: This will be the entry point of our application. It will parse the command line arguments and call the necessary functions to fetch data from the SugarCRM API and write it to a CSV file. It will not export any variables.

2. `api.ts`: This file will contain the function `fetchData` which will use the Axios library to make HTTP requests to the SugarCRM REST API v10. It will take in the URL, username, password, module name, offset and max records as parameters. It will export the `fetchData` function.

3. `jsonToCsv.ts`: This file will contain the function `convertToJson` which will take in the JSON data from the SugarCRM API and convert it to CSV format using a JSON to CSV library. It will export the `convertToJson` function.

4. `writeToFile.ts`: This file will contain the function `writeToFile` which will take in the CSV data and the output filename and write the data to the file. It will export the `writeToFile` function.

5. `utils.ts`: This file will contain utility functions such as error handlers for network errors, and possibly some helper functions for dealing with the API's pagination (since the API only returns a maximum of 1000 records per request). It will export the utility functions.

6. `package.json`: This file will contain the application's dependencies (including Axios and a JSON to CSV library), scripts for building and running the application, and other metadata.

The application will not use any DOM elements as it is a CLI application, not a web application. It will also not use any message names as it doesn't involve any messaging or event handling.

In terms of non-functional requirements, the application will be written in Typescript/Node.js and the build will output an executable binary. The application will handle network errors gracefully, return the maximum number of records to minimize API requests, and use the Axios library as the HTTP client. It will also use the SugarCRM REST API v10 and a JSON to CSV library to convert the API's JSON responses to CSV format.
